I am not felt good with Project :(

[+] Algorimth: I want to make the random init pipe: I want random distance between pipeUp and pipeDown and distance between 2 pipe.  

[+] Code: It's not clean :( 

But It also is my game for learn the Stage of libgdx and I learn more after make it. Haiz.  

I code in Ubuntu. If you want to run in Windows/Mac, you should change the path of Score_File in Constants.java ^^
